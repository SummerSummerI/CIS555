Drinking Alone by Moonlight (月下獨酌, pinyin: Yuè Xià Dú Zhuó)

    花間一壺酒。   A cup of wine, under the flowering trees;
    獨酌無相親。   I drink alone, for no friend is near.
    舉杯邀明月。   Raising my cup I beckon the bright moon,
    對影成三人。   For he, with my shadow, will make three men.

    月既不解飲。   The moon, alas, is no drinker of wine;
    影徒隨我身。   Listless, my shadow creeps about at my side.
    暫伴月將影。   Yet with the moon as friend and the shadow as slave
    行樂須及春。   I must make merry before the Spring is spent.

    我歌月徘徊。   To the songs I sing the moon flickers her beams;
    我舞影零亂。   In the dance I weave my shadow tangles and break.
    醒時同交歡。   While we were sober, three shared the fun;
    醉後各分散。   Now we are drunk, each goes his way.
    永結無情遊。   May we long share our odd, inanimate feast,
    相期邈雲漢。   And meet at last on the Cloudy River of the sky.
